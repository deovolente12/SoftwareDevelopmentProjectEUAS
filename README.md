Individual project, World Of Warcraft game database

What do I want to achieve in this project?

World of Warcraft is a game that has been loved by millions almost for two decades. As the game progressed over time, there are too much data stacked up for one individual to search for information they need for the game. The project's goal is to provide a viable search engine for the users and create a template for up-to-date information about the latest trend of the game (i.e. talents, specs, BIS (Best In Slot items)).

Main Milestones
